Information Assurance Fundamentals - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
Penetration testers find and exploit vulnerabilities
MICE, money, ideology, compromise or coercion, ego or extortion.
MEECES, money, ego, entertainment, cause, entrance, and status
AAA -
Authentication (something you know [password], something you have[fob], something you are[biometrics])
Authorization (rbac)
Accounting

plain text -> algo + key -> cipher text

Kerckhoffs
AES/DS4 are older symmetric encryption
RSA is an example of asymmetric encryption

input -> hashing -> message digest

switch connect devices of same network together
- if switch doesnt know where dest mac address is, it floods the pkt to all interfaces (ARP requests)
- switch starts learning (SourceAddressTable SAT which maps mac addr and i/f)
- switches dont change any part of frame
routers connect different networks together (control access lists)
mac address (48 bits) are physical address burned unto NIC
IPv4 (32 bits) are logical addresses bound via software (limited time)
subnet mask (network ID <all 1s> + host ID <all 0s>) - can span multiple octects
- network identifier (boolean AND of IP and subnet mask - lets source know that it's on same network)
- network broadcast address
ARP broadcast message (IP -> MAC mapping; only known IP unicasts its IP as ARP reply)
default gateway (router interface for managing connections between different networks)
- each interface of router connects different network
- router never broadcasts ARP
- routing tables (default route for other networks else send drop pkt and send error msg via ICMP)
- each router ARPs to get next hop address?
MAC address are flat (no hieracrhy) & IP addresses are geographical = so we need combination.

NIC (services -> daemons) using a port (logical number)
L2 - mac
L3 IP
L4 ports
- well known 0-1023) eg ftp21, webserver80
- registered 1024 - 49151
- dynamic 49152 - 65535 (client specific as needed)
TCP vs UDP (RTSP - realtime streaming protocol which is at L7 uses RTSP ordering of UDP)
- both TCP and UDP datagrams have source and dest ports

Autonomous Network (ISP)
Autonomous System Number - dynamic routing
IGP (interior gateway protocol => OSPF, EIGRP; main metric is bandwidth)
EGP (exterior gateway protocol => BGP

DHCP (dynamic host config proto) & DNS (domain name system)
RARP MAC -> IP but it was L2 so cant be used across networks
BOOTP (bootstrap protocol) encapsulated with IP
DHCP added scopes (ranges of IP addr used in dynamic fashion)
- [D]iscover
- [O]ffer
- [R]equest
- [A]ck
DNS Domain Name System
Firewalls - h/w(network based) or s/f(host based) based: filter traffic based on rules i.e permit/deny inbound/outbound traffic; sit on border
- they prevent unauth access to/from a system or network
- packet filtering (user defined rules)
--stateless : sessionless, high throughput, ACL, referencing, IP, ports
--stateful : sessions, stages of TCP
ALG (app layer gateway) - applies security mechanisms L7 on apps like HTTP, SSL, FTP, DNS
- DPI (deep packet inspection looking at headers) done by ALG: data sent in right format => DCI (deep content inspection)

IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
out of band, no latency VS in band, latency (traffic processed live)
- If IDS is attacked, it could me more damaging for network traffic
Honeypot -> honeynet (n/w of these systems)
- lure attackers, improve fw rules
- Deception s/f (run through virtualization)

Malware : malicious software - viruses(spread) and worms(replicate themselves across networks)
- viruses need a host file to infect
Logic Bombs
Trojan horses - do not replicate on local machine or network
RAT (remote admin tool)
Rootkit (permanent undetectable presence) => backdoor
Digital forensics takes place as part of incident response
- evidence acquired and imaged
- evidence analyzed
- report
